# Wall-of-Kindness
* Wall of kindness is a web portal where people can come to make donations to the registered non profit organizations / charities.

* The organizations register themselves on the site, post which user can select one to which he/she wants to make a donation and proceed to transfer the amount.
            
* By this we can help the poor in need, and we are always  ready to do any kind of activities in upcoming circumstances so to help the poor people from scarcity.

### Platform used:
* java,css,js

### Existing method:

In India at present the people are donating the item by approaching the poor people.
Its not mandatory that all people have to donate, but there is no change in solving the problems of poor people.
In order to get a change in India we help the poor people and reduce the death rate by developing a web site. 
There are some web sites which t\are not clearly understood by the people, so by referring some related web sites we developed additional improved features.
Since we don't have website for this concept., so we are creating a website to make easy way to donate.
 
### Proposed method:

User login, password
description of web page 
icons of the items
customer interacting security features 
verification of delivering by the customer
feedbacks
email/contact of web page developer

The web page is highly protected from the tracers, and no false hope given to the customer.
Details of the activities performed by the charity organizations are shown transparently to the donor.
